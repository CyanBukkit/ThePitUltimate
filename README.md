# ThePitStudy
## What is ThePitStudy and why should I use it?

ThePitStudy is designed for efficient server running.
* Simple to set up and use
* Extremely configurable
* Uses minimal CPU/Memory
* Safe for many players to use
* Insanely fast, when using the slowest mode
 
ThePitStudy is a fork of ThePitPremium that has huge speed and memory improvements and considerably more features.  
If you use other plugins which depend on ThePitPremium, simply having "TPS" installed will boost their performance.
